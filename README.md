This is a json configuration for Karabiner's "Complexe Modifications" to quickly type accent characters
on a QWERTY keyboard layout.

On a Mac there are already shortcuts to type accents, but the idea was to make them faster and to make
the accents used more often easier/faster to type. For example,
outputing a `é` using a Qwerty keyboard can be done in two steps:

1. press `option + e`
2. then press e

With this json, `é` can be printed by pressing simply long-pressing `e` while 
long-pressing `shift + e` would print a `è`.


List of shortcuts:
- long-press on `a` -> `à`
- long-press on `u` -> `ù`
- long-press on `e` -> `é`

- long-press on `e` + shift -> `è`
- `alt + e/i/o/u` -> `ê/î/ô/û`
